It uses a file which contains a\nlist of change sets. Each change set contains the instructions for updating the database, for example\n<em>create this table</em> or <em>delete this column</em> instructions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;changeSet id=&quot;1&quot; author=&quot;Egidio Caprino&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;createTable tableName=&quot;person&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;column name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; autoIncrement=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;constraints primaryKey=&quot;true&quot; nullable=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/column&gt;\n    &lt;column name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;varchar(50)&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;column name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;varchar(50)&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;constraints nullable=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/column&gt;\n  &lt;/createTable&gt;\n&lt;/changeSet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you start a new project, the Liquibase file would be empty and it will grow as you work on the project.</p>\n<p>If you are working on an existing project, you can create a change set from the current status of the database.\nThis would be your starting point.</p>\n<p>We use it to keep track of how we change the database structure but also for deploying database changes between\ndifferent environment. It is integrated in our build pipeline which also validates the changes against a partial-clone\nof the production database.</p>\n<p>The coolest part is that it is vendor agnostic which makes moving to a different database provider easier, unless you\nuse custom SQL commands (yes, it can do that too).</p>\n","formattedDate":"February 5, 2018"},"__N_SSG":true}
